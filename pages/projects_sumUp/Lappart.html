        "L'appart" is a french word that means "the appartement" or "the flat" in english. It's one of my biggest
        personnal project, but it stills a work in progress unfortunately.<br>
        I really hope that it will be ready for the end of 2020. <br>
        Come back later to check this out!

        We had one full-time month to develop it, and each one of us had specific tasks to accomplish. <br>
        We used Python to develop it, even for the graphic interface.<br>
        I used LBP patterns and k-means algorithms to recognize striations inside the images,
        and it worked pretty well. We improved it using machine learning.<br>
        You can find the github link below and clone it if you want to test the software :
